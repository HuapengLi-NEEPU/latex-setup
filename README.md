This goes in `~/Library/texmf/tex` on macOS. It provides small LaTeX
packages and custom class files for cheatsheets, worksheets, articles,
and books.

Note that you will need to install `CavalcadeMono.otf` on your system
(just double-click the file and follow the directions) and use the
LuaTeX engine.
